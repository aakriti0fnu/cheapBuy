|-|-----|---------|
|2| short release cycles|https://github.com/aakriti0fnu/cheapBuy/graphs/contributors|
|2| workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others)|evidence in GH|
|3| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing |[README.md](https://github.com/aakriti0fnu/cheapBuy/blob/main/README.md)|
|3|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  |[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/aakriti0fnu/cheapBuy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)|
|2|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly  |in GH|
|3|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) |[requirements.txt](https://github.com/aakriti0fnu/cheapBuy/blob/main/requirements.txt)|
|2|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |https://github.com/aakriti0fnu/cheapBuy/graphs/contributors|
|2|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | |
|2|Number of commits: by different people  |[Number of Commits](https://github.com/aakriti0fnu/cheapBuy/graphs/commit-activity)|
